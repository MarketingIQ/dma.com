/**
 Represents a <FBSDKLoginButton /> tag in TVML.
 You should not need to use this class directly. Instead, make sure you
 initialize a `FBSDKTVInterfaceFactory` instance correctly.

 This element can dispatch the following events to Javascript, which map to corresponding
 messages of `FBSDKDeviceLoginButtonDelegate`.
 - `onFacebookLogin`
 - `onFacebookLogout`
 - `onFacebookLoginCancel`
 - `onFacebookLoginError`

 These events can bubble up the DOM.

 The '<FBSDKLoginButton />' tag can also have the following attributes:
 - either a `readPermissions` or (not both) `publishPermissions` attribute whose value is a comma delimited
 list of permissions to request.
 - `redirectURL` an optional URL to redirect the user to after completing the login.
