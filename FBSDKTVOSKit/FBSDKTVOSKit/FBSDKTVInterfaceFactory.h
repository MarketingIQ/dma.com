/**
 An implementation of `TVInterfaceCreating` for using FBSDKTVOSKit elements in TVML apps.
 You should assign an instance of this factory prior to the construction
  of your `TVApplicationController`. For example,
 <code>
 TVInterfaceFactory.sharedInterfaceFactory().extendedInterfaceCreator = FBSDKTVInterfaceFactory()
 </code>

 If you have your own `TVInterfaceCreating` implementation, use `initWithTVInterfaceCreating:`.

 This class will also register Facebook `TVViewElement` subclasses to the `TVElementFactory`.
 This extends TVML with the following tags:

 * `<FBSDKLoginButton />` (see FBSDKTVLoginButtonElement.h for details)
 * `<FBSDKLoginViewController />` (see FBSDKTVLoginViewControllerElement.h for details)
