/**
 A button that initiates a log in or log out flow upon tapping.

 `LoginButton` works with `AccessToken.current` to determine what to display,
 and automatically starts authentication when tapped (i.e., you do not need to manually subscribe action targets).

 Like `LoginManager`, you should make sure your app delegate is connected to `ApplicationDelegate`
 in order for the button's delegate to receive messages.

 `LoginButton` has a fixed height of @c 30 pixels, but you may change the width.
 Initializing the button with `nil` frame will size the button to its minimum frame.
